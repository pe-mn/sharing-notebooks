## Dataset

> Ford GoBike System Data: This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.


## Summary of Findings

> In the start hour distribution We note that:
    - For Subscribers we have two obvious peaks:
        - One in the normal work start time (from 7 to 9 am).
        - The other peak in the normal work end time (from 4 to 7 pm).
    - For Customers the peaks are less obvious:
        - Some of the customers are using bikes to go for their work --> there is a high possibility that these customers will subscribe soon especially if we made offers for them.
        - While others use bikes for other day activities, we need to think, what can we do to increse their subscription? 

> From the Numerical columns distributions we notice:**
    - most of the trips have a duration less than 20 minutes. 
    - most of the users are between 22 and 38 years old.
    - the users count decreases as their age increases.
    - there is almost no trips between midnight and 7 AM.

> More subscribers make shorter rides than customers. 
    - This can be due to the difference in the purpose/nature of each user type rides: 
        - Subscribers most use bikes to go for work (may be near work locations).
        - Customers may use bikes for sports activities or other purposes.

 
## Key Insights for Presentation

> User Types Count.
> Customers VS Subscribers Rides in weekdays.
> Relationship between Duration of the trip and the Age of the user.

> Changes in design:
     - Adding Titles, X & Y labels.
     - Adjust X-ticks and Y-ticks.
     - Polishing the graphs.
